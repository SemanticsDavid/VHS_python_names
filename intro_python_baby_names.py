print 'a = 3, b=4'
### describe multiplication, division, power, mod
a=3; b=4; c,d = 5,6
print a+b, c+d
a='anthony'

print 'a-b, not working'

2. Describe lists, sets, dictionaries

-- advice: minimize the basics unless they are directly needed 
-- advide: start with a working cool example, use it as a hook to what we will learn

5. load baby names

6. organize in dictionaries
