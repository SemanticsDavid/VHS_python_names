# VHS_python_names
Code to manage long lists of names and do fun things with them

The main functions and sample code is all in the file useful_functions.py, download all files to the same directory and run from ipython as "run useful_functions.py"

Alternatively, you can import the functions directly into ipython by "import useful_functions as uf", and then you can run the functions from ipython by preceding them with uf; for example: "Pi = uf.load_Pi()"
